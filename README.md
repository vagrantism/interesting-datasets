This repository contains the video generated through various frames from a open 
frames dataset for Queuing activity available on 
https://vhosts.eecs.umich.edu/vision/activity-dataset.html.

This repository also includes a jupyter notebook to tie back the frames 
available in the dataset to video with proper encoding.
